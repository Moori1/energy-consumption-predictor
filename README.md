# 🌱 Energy Consumption Predictor

This project focuses on predicting energy consumption using data-driven methods to support sustainable building design and energy optimization.

---

## 📘 Overview
This project was developed as part of my studies in **Energy and Environmental Technology** at **Arcada University of Applied Sciences**.  
It demonstrates how energy data can be analyzed and modeled to identify trends and improve efficiency in buildings.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Collects and analyzes building energy consumption data  
- Predicts future energy use based on input variables  
- Visualizes results in easy-to-understand graphs  
- Supports decision-making for sustainable design

---

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)  
- **Data:** CSV dataset of energy consumption  
- **Other tools:** Revit, OneClick LCA (for modeling and carbon footprint assessment)

---

## 📊 Results
- Model achieved XX% prediction accuracy  
- Identified major factors influencing energy consumption  
- Demonstrated potential for energy savings and emission reduction
